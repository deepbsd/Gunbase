- Add a short description of your website - e.g.: _“Welcome to GunBase, the largest firegun database on the Internet!“_
- Make the Home button re-render the home page without reloading it. It seems like a bug to me
- I really liked the search on the home page. Real time filtering as you type is really cool!

- in your function `getAllGuns()` you are returning a promise that you explicity resolve in the success callback, but you never reject it - even when you get an error

[11:30]
you should reject the promise from the error callback that you set in your `jQuery.ajax()` call


Joel suggestion:  "Suggestions: 1) try to do one thing at a time, and finish what you’ve started.
it avoids mixing too many bugs of two major tasks (it’s almost impossible to avoid bugs at all, but if
you move to another task only when you’re confident that the last one was properly fullfilled chances
are that you’ll not have so many bugs from multiple tasks to solve); 2) try to take more value from
branches. create one branch per feature/task/bug/issue, and only merge it if everything is really working
as expected. be extremely careful at this point"

[9:23]
However, we had multiple patterns for modularization, both synchronous and asynchronous, as well as patterns for front-end and back-end

I guess all the external libraries are examples of that, right?

Module Pattern
Revealing Module Pattern
AMD (Async Module Definition)
CommonJS Modules (the one that Node.js uses, i.e.: `require()`)
UMD (Universal Module Definition - mostly AMD + CommonJS, w/ fallback to global scope)"
